Visual analysis and changing of the pixels in the ever famous Lenna.
Just run the file and see the preety colors.
The randomized picture has all pixels randomized so it looks like pure static.
You can either enjoy the entropy or copy and paste one or two of the comments below the variable designations
into the designations and it will make for a randomly color shaded picture.
